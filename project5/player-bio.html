                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Travis Hunter is one of the most unique prospects in college football history, having earned the Heisman Trophy for his exceptional two-way play at the University of Colorado. Originally from Suwanee, Georgia, Hunter was a five-star recruit who initially committed to Florida State before flipping to Jackson State to play for coach Deion Sanders. When Sanders moved to Colorado, Hunter followed and has flourished in Boulder.</p>
                
                <p>Hunter's rare ability to excel at both cornerback and wide receiver at the highest level of college football has drawn comparisons to legendary two-way players like Charles Woodson. His impact on both sides of the ball has been transformative for the Colorado program.</p>
