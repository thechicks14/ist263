    My name is Connor Hicks.  I am an Applied Data Analytics major who is considering minoring in Sports Analytics.  My core competencies include data analysis, statistical modeling, technical support, leadership, time management, communication, problem solving, and youth mentorship.  To unwind, I enjoy playing guitar, I have played for the last 10 years, performing at recitals and school concerts.
